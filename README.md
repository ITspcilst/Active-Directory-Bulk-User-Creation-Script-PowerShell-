# 📁 Bulk Active Directory User Creation and password reset — PowerShell Automation

This project automates the creation of **Active Directory (AD) user accounts** using a CSV file, making it easy to onboard large numbers of users quickly and consistently.
This project automates the **resetting of passwords** for multiple Active Directory (AD) users using a **CSV file**, also demonstrates practical skills in **AD automation**, **bulk operations**, **PowerShell scripting**, **secure credential handling**, and **file output management**.
It is designed for IT administrators who need a **fast, consistent, and secure** way to reset many user passwords at once.

---

## ✨ Project Components

The automation script is a **production-style** tool designed to demonstrate IT administration, automation, and PowerShell skills. It includes:

* ✔ **CSV-driven user input**: Data for each user is sourced directly from a standard CSV file.
* ✔ **Per-user OU placement**: Supports placing each user in a different Organizational Unit.
* ✔ **Automatic group membership**: Manages group assignments during creation.
* ✔ **Random secure password generation**: Generates unique, secure passwords for each account.
* ✔ **Logging of all actions**: Comprehensive recording of success, skips, and errors.
* ✔ **Full error handling**: Robust logic to manage exceptions gracefully.
* ✔ **Idempotent execution**: Safely skips users that already exist.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 Bulk User Creation & Data Handling

The script reads user data from a CSV file and automatically creates each account in AD.

### 🔹 Directory Structure & Group Assignment

* **Per-User OU Support**: Each user's designated **Organizational Unit (OU)** is specified in the CSV, allowing for flexible AD structuring.
* **Automatic Group Assignment**: Users are added to security groups listed in the `Groups` column (supports **multiple groups** using a semicolon `;` as a delimiter).

### 🔹 Security & Passwords

Each user receives a **unique, randomly generated password**. The account is created with the **"password-change-on-login"** setting enabled for immediate security enforcement.

### 🔹 Logging & Error Handling

All activity is logged to a dedicated `creation-log.txt` file, recording:

* Successful creations
* Group assignments
* Skipped existing users
* Any errors encountered (e.g., OU not found, group not found)

### 🔹 Safe Re-Run / Idempotent

The script is safe to run repeatedly:

* **Existing accounts are skipped**, not overwritten or modified.
* **Only new users** present in the CSV are created on subsequent runs.

## 📄 CSV Format

The primary input for the script is the **`Input/users.csv`** file. The script expects the following columns to successfully create the user accounts:

| Column Name | Description | Example Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SamAccountName** | The unique logon name for the user. | `jdoe` |
| **FirstName** | User's given name. | `John` |
| **LastName** | User's surname. | `Doe` |
| **DisplayName** | Full name as displayed in the AD Global Address List. | `John Doe` |
| **OUPath** | The distinguished name of the Organizational Unit (OU) where the user will be placed. | `OU=HelpDesk,DC=corp,DC=local` |
| **Groups** | Security groups to add the user to. Use a semicolon (`;`) to separate multiple groups. | `IT-Users;GroupB` |

### Example `users.csv` Entry:

| SamAccountName | FirstName | LastName | DisplayName | Department | Title | Phone | OU | Groups | Domain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
